### Hackathon 

Project ideas are listed in the [issues page](https://github.com/nextflow-io/hack17/issues).

Feel free to join one of the listed project or create a new one if you have a specific idea on which you would like to work. 

We also encourage you to create a separate GitHub repository to keep track your project files and link it to the relative [project idea](https://github.com/nextflow-io/hack17/issues) in the above link. This will allow us to share and follow-up the hackathon achievement.
